## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark crimson (#8B0000). The primary color represents corruption through its similarity to blood, is vibrant but professional, and still has enough brightness to contrast well with a dark background.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222). This color establishes the dark scheme and a serious tone appropriate for this content.
- Accent color: Dark orange (#D4A373). This color provides contrast and highlights points of user interaction. It's brightness and saturation is clearly distinct from the primary and background colors, while remaining within the chosen analogous hue range.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look. 
- The leaderboard should be structured as a single-page application with the table taking center stage, optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. Sticky headers to persist sortability.
- Simple, universally-understood icons to represent the different political allegiance categories and types of evidence or sources.
- Subtle transition animations for sorting and filtering updates to enhance the user experience without distracting from the data.
